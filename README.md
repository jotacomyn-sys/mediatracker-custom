> *A media tracker for the obsessively organised — the kind of person who cares which one of the 14 productions of "La casa de Bernarda Alba" they actually saw.*

Self-hosted tracker for everything you watch, read, play, listen to and attend — movies, TV, video games, books, audiobooks, theatre and YouTube videos — with the level of detail that the rest of the trackers don't bother with.

---

## What it is

A media tracker built for **completionists**, Spanish-first but localized to seven languages:

- **Per-medium consumption verbs**, not just "seen": played / watched / read / listened / attended. The same item can have several.
- **Two-way Jellyfin integration**: marks items as downloaded when they appear in your Jellyfin library, opens "Play in Jellyfin" deeplinks, sync-back when you watch something there.
- **YouTube as a first-class media type**: subscribe to channels, mark videos watched, view the recent feed, persistent cache that survives YouTube's RSS outages.
- **Theatre with serious metadata**: Wikidata SPARQL for canonical works + scraping of teatro.es (CDT/INAEM, Spain) for contemporary stagings.
- **Audiobooks** and books with progress in hours/minutes or pages, with last-position tracking.
- **Duplicate detection** and merge tooling that doesn't lose seen / ratings / lists.
- **Full backup / restore** including auto-restore on missing data.db, plus JSON and Letterboxd CSV exports.
- **i18n**: 7 languages (es / en / pt / fr / de / da / ko) with a custom catalogue.

Designed to live in your own infrastructure next to Jellyfin, qBittorrent, Home Assistant and whatever else.

## Install

Requires Docker Engine 20+ with the Compose v2 plugin.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/javimentallab/mediatoc.git
cd mediatoc

cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
${EDITOR:-nano} docker-compose.yml      # set IGDB_CLIENT_ID/SECRET, optional Jellyfin/YouTube/Google

docker compose build mediatoc
docker compose up -d mediatoc
```

Open `http://localhost:7481` — the first user to register becomes admin.

**Tokens and credentials** are managed from `Settings → Application tokens`:
- IGDB (required for video games)
- TMDB API key (recommended for "Where to watch" providers and episode runtimes — paste it in the UI; it's stored at `/storage/tmdb-key.json` with mode 0600)
- Jellyfin (URL + API key)
- YouTube (Google OAuth)

## Companion: `contrib/jf-torrents-organize`

Optional but recommended if you run **qBittorrent + Jellyfin** alongside MediaTOC.

qBittorrent saves torrents at release-style paths
(`/data/torrents/Title (YYYY) [Bluray 1080p][Esp]/foo.mkv`). Jellyfin matches
metadata poorly against those names, so MediaTOC's **Downloaded** badge —
which reads from Jellyfin — never lights up. The fix isn't to rename the
qBit folder (that breaks seeding); it's to create **hardlinks** in a clean
parallel structure that Jellyfin indexes correctly. Same inode, zero extra
bytes on disk.

`contrib/jf-torrents-organize/` ships a small Python script + systemd units
that do exactly that, plus a `/Library/Refresh` call to Jellyfin so the new
entries appear immediately. It reads the Jellyfin URL + API key directly
from MediaTOC's own storage (`/storage/jellyfin-config.json`) so if you
already configured Jellyfin in MediaTOC, no extra credentials needed.

See [`contrib/jf-torrents-organize/README.md`](contrib/jf-torrents-organize/README.md)
for layout requirements, env vars and footguns.

## Host-side backups

The image doesn't ship a cron — recommended pattern:

```cron
0 3 * * * /path/to/backup-mediatoc.sh >> /path/to/backup.log 2>&1
30 3 * * * bash /path/to/verify-backup.sh --quiet >> /path/to/verify.log 2>&1
```

Both scripts use `docker exec mediatoc` and rotate keeping 7 daily / 4 weekly / 3 monthly. Best to keep them outside the image, next to the data volume.

## Build internals

The image is produced by composing a series of small JS scripts on top of a base image — see [`PATCHES.md`](PATCHES.md) for the full inventory. Each script is idempotent, fails loudly if the upstream layout changes (so build breaks rather than silently producing wrong code), and is one-Docker-layer per script for cache efficiency.

CSS / JS edits regenerate the brotli + gzip pre-compressed variants so the static server (and any CDN in front) doesn't keep serving stale bytes after a rebuild.

```

> ⚠ **Important**: any patch that modifies `/app/build/**` (controllers, queries, locales, the SPA bundle, …) MUST live in `patch_02` or later. The bonukai base image's `npm install` step (run between `patch_01` and `patch_02`) re-extracts `/app/build/` from package sources, silently wiping anything `patch_01` wrote there.

## Releasing

```sh
./release.sh 1.1.4
```

- Aborts if working tree is dirty, branch isn't `main`, tag already exists, or version isn't semver.
- Bumps `FORK_VERSION` in `patch_02_backend_db_items.js`.
- Commits, tags `v1.1.4`, pushes both, drafts a GitHub release with the commit log since the previous tag for you to edit before publishing.
